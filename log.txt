CMake Error at C:/Users/Ian/devel/CMake/Modules/CMakeTestCSCCompiler.cmake:21 (MESSAGE):
  The CSC compiler
  "C:/Users/Ian/devel/CMake/Tests/CSC/vc/CMakeFiles/csc_adapt.exe" is not
  able to compile a simple test program.

  It fails with the following output:

   Change Dir: C:/Users/Ian/devel/CMake/Tests/CSC/vc/CMakeFiles/CMakeTmp

  Project file
  'C:\Users\Ian\devel\CMake\Tests\CSC\vc\CMakeFiles\CMakeTmp\cmTryCompileExec.vcproj'
  could not be loaded.

  The project is either missing from disk or access was denied.

  One or more projects in the solution could not be loaded for the following
  reason(s):

  

  The project file or web has been moved, renamed or is not on your computer.

  

  These projects will be labeled as unavailable in Solution Explorer.  Expand
  the project node to show the reason the project could not be loaded.

  Invalid project

  

  Use:

  vcexpress [solutionfile | projectfile | anyfile.ext] [switches]

  

  The first argument for devenv is usually a solution file or project file.

  You can also use any other file as the first argument if you want to have
  the

  file open automatically in an editor.  When you enter a project file, the
  IDE

  looks for an .sln file with the same base name as the project file in the

  parent directory for the project file.  If no such .sln file exists, then
  the

  IDE looks for a single .sln file that references the project.  If no such
  single

  .sln file exists, then the IDE creates an unsaved solution with a default
  .sln

  file name that has the same base name as the project file.

  

  Command line builds:

  devenv solutionfile.sln /build [ solutionconfig ] [ /project
  projectnameorfile [ /projectconfig name ] ]

  Available command line switches:

  

  /Log		Logs IDE activity to the specified file for troubleshooting.

  /ResetSettings	Restores the IDE's default settings, optionally resets to

  		the specified VSSettings file.

  /SafeMode	Launches the IDE in safe mode loading minimal windows.

  

  Product-specific switches:

  

  /debugexe	Open the specified executable to be debugged.  The

  		remainder of the command line is passed to this

  		executable as its arguments.

  /useenv		Use PATH, INCLUDE, LIBPATH, and LIB environment variables

  		instead of IDE paths for VC++ builds.

  

  To attach the debugger from the command line, use:

  	VsJITDebugger.exe -p <pid>

  

  

  CMake will not be able to correctly generate this project.
